### Rational Method Compute Resource
Returns a dictionary of model input parameters and the resulting peak discharge for a user-selected location.

The Rational Method is a simple technique for estimating a peak runoff from a small watershed. It was developed by Kuichling, 1889 for small drainage basins in urban areas. The rational method is expressed by the equation:

>Q = CiA
>
>where
>
>Q = design peak runoff rate, in cubic feet per second<br />
>C = runoff coefficient, dimensionless – defined as the ratio of the peak runoff rate to the rainfall intensity<br />
> i = rainfall intensity, in inches per hour, and<br />
>A = drainage area, in acres

## Precipitation Duration (PDUR) Codes
The following precipitation duration codes will be accepted by the services

| Code  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| I6H2Y  | Maximum 6-hour precipitation that occurs on average once in 2 years  |
| I6H100Y  | Maximum 6-hour precipitation that occurs on average once in 100 years  |
| I24H2Y  | Maximum 24-hour precipitation that occurs on average once in 2 years  |
| I24H100Y  | Maximum 24-hour precipitation that occurs on average once in 100 years  |
